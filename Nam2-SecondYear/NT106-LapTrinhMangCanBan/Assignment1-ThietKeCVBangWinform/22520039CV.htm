        <p><b> Intern Researcher</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>My current field of research is Software Security using AI. I am interested in using ML/DL-based models to detect vulnerabilities. My main task is to read papers published by well-known universities, study their new technologies, results, and then I will try to deploy all of them by myself and make a report of it. My final destination is to have a Q1-ranked paper for myself.</li>
            <li>Lately, I have done some research on applying XAI into the above models in order to improve their reliability. For example, I have done some small demonstrations with LIME and gathered some really good results. Moreover, I am studying GNN and writing a paper about it.</li>
            <li>I have also successfully published 1 paper for a conference.</li>
